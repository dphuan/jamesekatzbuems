Hi, I am Yihan Jia, a Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/com/academics/emerging-media-studies/" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">Division of Emerging Media Studies at Boston University</a>. I’m also a graudate affiliate of the <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/crc/" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">Communication Research Center</a>.

My research primarily focuses on <strong>immersive media </strong>and <strong>positive media psychology</strong>. Specifically, I look at how certain features of immersive media (e.g., <strong>video games </strong>and <strong>virtual reality</strong>) influence people’s perception and cognitive processing in the virtual environment, and how it leads to short-term and long-term effects. 

In addition to media psychology, I also have strong research interests in <strong>online communities</strong>. Specifically, I seek to answer how certain online communities are formed, and how they function and sustain using <strong>computational methods</strong>. My most recent publication looks at how parasocial relationship and interaction on the streaming platform <em>Twitch</em> lead to viewers' sense of community and thus contribute to overall community health. 

I obtained my M.S. and B.A. degrees in mass communication/media studies from <a href="https://cla.purdue.edu/communication/" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue University</a>. I have interned and worked for Purdue LGBTQ Center and New Oriental Education & Technology Group. Outside academia, I enjoy photography (portfolio <a href="https://yihanjia.github.io/photography" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">here</a>), chrous singing, and music composing.
